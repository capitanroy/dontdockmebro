Scripted Discourse Installs 

Discourse Forums is next generation tech, and has up to now required either serious tech skills, or a bit of monies to get it going in the cloud. I saw a need for people to install discourse on their cheap vps, outside of the docker containers which require expensive cloud environments. 

Now you can get a working bleeding edge forum architecture without breaking the bank, or cracking open the IT books. I've done all the leg work, and installed Discourse in dozens of server environments. Now I bring to you an easy to follow step by step guide to getting your forums rocking without having to have an understanding of what's really going on to get it done.
